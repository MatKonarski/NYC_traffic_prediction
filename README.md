This repository contains the main content of my 2022 HSE coursework.

The coursework is based on volume demand prediction for taxi and bike ride in NYC.

The objectives are:
  - To implement an efficient Machine Learning prediction of traffic volume demand
  - To evaluate the efficiency of using a GNN 
  - To use multi modal informations in order to improve the prediction for each mode
